3. Create a new bucket named `article-images` and set it to public
4. Navigate to the SQL Editor
5. Run the SQL commands from `migrations/fix_storage_policies.sql` to set up the storage policies

### Storage Policies

The application uses the following storage policies:

- Users can upload files to their own folder (based on their user ID)
- Users can update files in their own folder
- Users can delete files in their own folder
- Anyone can view files in the bucket

### Testing File Uploads

You can test file uploads by navigating to `/upload-test` in the application. This page provides a simple interface for uploading files and viewing your uploaded images.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with file uploads, check the following:

1. Make sure you're signed in
2. Check that the storage bucket is set to public
3. Verify that the storage policies are set up correctly
4. Check the browser console for error messages
